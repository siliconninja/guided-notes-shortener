# Guided Notes Shortener (AHK)
A script created for AutoHotkey that shortens blank delimeters of various lengths (e.g. World War ____ or President _______) when your class's notes are in the "guided" notes format.

Just copy your notes into the dialog, and paste the new ones with much shorter blanks into your notes.

This script was created to easily enter text into those blanks in OneNote or similar note-taking applications.

## Examples (try it!)
**Try copying/pasting these into the the text box that pops up when you run it:**

World War I was also called the ____ War.

__________ was the president in 1968.

**What should get copied to your clipboard after execution:**

World War I was also called the _ War.

_ was the president in 1968.
